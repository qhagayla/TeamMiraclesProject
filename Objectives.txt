General Objective:
- The main objective of this project is to develop a web-based system for the management of documents for the scheduling and evaluation of On-The-Job trainees that meets the needs of the client in compliance with engineering and other relevant standards while taking into consideration the constraints including economic, environmental, sustainability, safety, risk, public health, welfare, social, global, and cultural along with computation of trade-offs from selected constraints.

Specific Objectives:
-Develop a web application that:
--Accepts userâ€™s official university email account, name, account type (whether faculty or student), status (whether regular or irregular) and  section for account creation.
--Allows the student user to upload documents limited to pdf file types, view details of partner companies, and track their progress based on a list of requirements.
--Displays the uploaded files of the student user for faculty review.
--Filters reports containing aggregated tracking data for document compliance of individual students by user's id or report title.
--Manages students records by semester and academic year with ready to print in a .pdf format.
-Test and evaluate the accuracy of the system
